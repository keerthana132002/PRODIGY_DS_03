# PRODIGY_DS_03

In this project, I build a Decision Tree Classifier model to predict the safety evaluation of cars based on various attributes.

The dataset used for this project is car_evaluation.csv, which includes features such as buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, capacity, size of luggage boot, and safety.

Also, I built two Decision Tree Classifier models to predict the safety of the car: one with the Gini index criterion and another with the Entropy criterion. The models yielded very good performance, with an accuracy of 0.8021 in both cases.

Model with Gini Index Criterion:

Training set accuracy: 0.7865
Test set accuracy: 0.8021
The training and test set accuracies are quite comparable, indicating no signs of overfitting.

Model with Entropy Criterion:

Training set accuracy: 0.7865
Test set accuracy: 0.8021
The training and test set accuracies are the same as those with the Gini index criterion, again indicating no signs of overfitting.


In both cases, the training and test set accuracy scores are the same, likely due to the small dataset size. The confusion matrix and classification report also indicate very good model performance.
